# SaaS Product Design Brief - ReSpace Interior Design App

## Goal

You are an industry-veteran SaaS product designer. You've built high-touch UIs for FANG-style companies.

Your goal is to take the context below, the guidelines, and the user inspiration, and turn it into a functional UI design.

## Guidelines

### Aesthetics

- Bold simplicity with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences
- Breathable whitespace complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy
- Strategic negative space calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization
- Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement
- Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture
- Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management
- Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity
- Accessibility-driven contrast ratios paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability
- Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency
- Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency

### Practicalities

- Simulate an iPhone device frame, as this is a design exercise
- Use lucide react icons
- Use Tailwind 4.1 for CSS
- This is meant to be a simulated phone. Do not render scroll bars

### Project-Specific Guidelines

**Philosophy**

ReSpace embodies "Thoughtful Transformation." We believe every space has untapped potential, and technology should empower—not overwhelm—the journey of discovery. Our design language balances aspirational sophistication with approachable warmth, making professional-quality interior design accessible to everyone. We're not decorating; we're reimagining. We're not suggesting; we're inspiring.

## App Style Guide

The style system and how to use it is here: design-system/styles-new.md

## Context

### App Overview

We are building a consumer focused interior design app for Home Owners and Renters. The idea is that users can upload images of a space (either empty or filled), and the app can help them re-imagine the space using LLMs.

### Task

Follow the guidelines above precisely to ensure correctness. Your output should be a horizontal series of vertical screens showcasing each view specified below. Always put new screen-series on a new row.

Give me 3 looks of the following screen. Each should be a unique take on the core concept, but conform to the overall app style and philosophy:

$ARGUMENTS

## Output

Make sure your outputs are being properly rendered via the main app root of Create React App. Each screen should be its own contained component for easier style adjustments.
